# Arkady-Smith-Graphical-Optimizer
A simple tool that changes the graphical settings in The Casebook of Arkady smith. So lower-end machines can play as well.

Or just crank your Graphics to the max and play on the highest graphics possible in The Casebook of Arkady Smith.

Sometimes the Tool will register as a virus. This is a false positive. Meaning Windows is confused as to what the application does.

Amd because it's messing with .ini files which are configuration files. It thinks the tool is a virus when it isn't.
